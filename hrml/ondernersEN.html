                <H3>My studentjob at the Lottery</H3>
                    <div class = "tekst">
                        <p>In the nice summer of 2018 I had a studentjob at the National Lottery. </p>     
                 <p>The building of my work was in Brussels and I worked there for 2 weeks. What meant my colleagues where not all Dutch
                 </br> so I had to bring my best French to work together.</p> 
                 <p>I worked at the marketing section where I was analysing concurention and other big company's for the first few days. </p>
                 </br> 
                 <p>Because of my studies in IT I knew how to analyse the right stuff and make a presentation for my team.</p>
                 <p>Another task I had to do was on the database. I had to write all the handwritten forms in the database</p>
                
             <p>So I learned a lot more about working for a company at an office witch means im a little more prepered for my upcomming internship.</p>

            <H3>My first Hackaton</H3>
            <p>In my 2nd year I participated at a Hackaton in Antwero. We started early in the morning with breakfast and we also got all the information for what we had to do that day.</p>
               <p>The goal of the Hackaton was to crack a code that you get by coding plenty of exercises in Java or other programming languages(i chose for java).</p>
                <p>At the end of the day they gave away prices for the winning teams, but because it was an event for 3th year students</p>
                <p>I sadly didn't get the price but it was a nice day anyways.</p>

                <H3>My Studentclub</H3>
                <p>Before my 2019 vacation I got chosen to work as public relation for my studentclub.</p>
                <p>My studentclub is linked to my field of study and that is also the reason I joined the club.</p>
                <p>In this vacation period I had to make sure to keep the outside relations of the club going well. </p>
                <p>So to find new sponsors I had to do a lot of research and I had to use my social skills to get good deals.</p>
                <p>It's something I really enjoy and is gonna help me to improve my socials skills and my knowledge for the comming years.</p>
