<h2>About myself.</h2>
<p>My name is Jens Crucke, I am a computer science student of the Hogeschool Gent campus Schoonmeersen.</p>
<p>I was born on november 23, 1999.</p>
<p> My secondary school I followed at SFI Melle, I studied IT.</p>
<p> I have played football, I did this for 8 years. Now I chill with friends and I also game a lot.</p>
<p>About my working experience I've been working in the Makro, in the restaurant and 1 day in Delhaize.</p>
<p>I myself am interested in programming and I would like to do go with it as subject for next year.</p>

<h2>Some more about myself (2nd bachelor year).</h2>
<p>My interest in business is growing stronger by day. I am working as public relations for my student club,</p>
<p>I did a student job at the marketingsection and the combination IT and business is really interesting in my opinion.</p>
<p>In my 3th year im going to choose for e-business because I like to combination of the two.</p>
<p>I also did some tests this year where the results where that I am social and someone who wants to enjoy their life. </p>
<p>I also am someone who asks a lot of question to make sure I am not doing anything wrong, I am also very truthfull, even when the</p>
<p>truth is gonna hurt, if it helps I will tell the truth. Ofcourse I have some things i need to work on</p>
<p>for example my planning skills ar not the best and I'm also a bit messy.</p>


<h2>Some more about myself (3th bachelor year)</h2>
<p>My 3th year was in times of Covid, so everything was online.</p>
<p>The big subject I had was my internship. Even tho it was online, it was a very succesfull internship. </p>
<p>Everything this year was via Teams. Sessions,lessons, exams where all online.</p>
<p>It was a special year that I would not like to do over again.</p>
<p>But I still put effort in my studies, and learned a lot like every year.</p>
<p>As IT student, I have the feeling that I have enough experience now.</p>


<h2>Future</h2>
<p>I would like to finish another study called "business"</p>
<p>THis because i have interest in both IT and Business. This is wy I chose for E-Business this year.</p>
<p>What I want to do after this, I don't know yet. It can do many different ways.</p>
