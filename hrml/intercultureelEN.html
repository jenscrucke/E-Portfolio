<h2>Examples of cultural differences</h2>
<p>An example of a culture difference is that there are high and low context cultures..</p>
<p>A high context culture is a culture with a long history and many traditions, a low context culture has less  traditions.</p>
        <p> In a high context culture is implicit and less direct communicated and is formally in  dealings</p>
            <p> This can provide for a conflict in which the culture with high context itself can feel offended by the difference in interaction and communication..</p>
                <p> One has to adjust to the culture than to resolve this conflict.</p>
    
    
                    <p> In some cultures sellers are more intrusive than  sellers in other cultures.
                        </p>
                        <p> This ensures that customers who come from other cultures their not at ease by the behavior of the sellers.</p>
                            <p>Or the other way around the customers do not get the intrest of the sellers little talk.</p>
                                <p> By the limited income in low-wage countries  the sellers are more intrusive by their circumstances.</p>

                                <h4>De Wever: "the Netherlands is guilty of cocaïneproblem in Antwerp’ </h4>
                                <p> 04/04/2018 at 21:13 by pvm | Bron: BELGA</p>
                                
                                <p>According to Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA) is the debt of the Netherlands that cocaine trafficking has moved from Rotterdam to Antwerp.</p>
                                <p> Our neighbour would by his policy of tolerance even have ‘a erfschuld to Europe.</p>
                                <p> De wever was on a Wednesday guest at the current affairs programme Nieuwsuur on the Dutch channel NPO2. There he took off to the Dutch policy of tolerance,</p>
                                <p> that according to him was made that the organized crime deeply ensconced hit in the society.</p>
                                <p> "And now we share, with a port which is very important for South America, joining in the clapping," he said. </p>
                                <p> Half of the cocaine in Europe is via Antwerp. "Five years ago it was still five thousand pounds,</p>
                                <p> we found forty thousand pounds - and our effort to search for drugs is not increased.</p>
                                <p> The influx is  from Rotterdam to Antwerp will be shifted’, continued De Wever. </p>
                                <p> ‘The organised crime is in the Netherlands, but they are looking for accomplices here in Antwerp.’</p>
                                <p> The Antwerp mayor repeated his intention to do more to tackle flows of money from the drug world.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="lol">associated with the movie "Patser"</p>
                                <br>
                                <p> In a film with Ali B . He plays a life-threatening Dutch-Moroccan gangster.
                                    </p>
                                <p> In the film there also will be shown that the ' patser' in Netherlands are more dangerous and masculine.</p>
                                <p>That they face more and so on. There is also businnes done between the "patsers" of Netherlands and the "patsers" of Belgium (Antwerp).
                                    </p>
                                <p> We demonstrate that the Dutch gangsters are maybe cooler because they do much more and in larger quantities. </p>
                                <p> This because there are many more drugs in Netherlands than in Belgium.</p>
